Creating a gaze estimation model involves several steps, including data preprocessing, model architecture design, and training the model using datasets like MPIIGaze, MPIIFaceGaze, or ETH-XGaze. Below is an example outline and code snippets for creating a gaze estimation model using PyTorch. I'll providestructure for a model, focusing on MPIIGaze.
